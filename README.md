## Summary of the problem

Our client Jhoner Aumber Gomez López asked to make a website in the form
of e-commerce called ISGREATSHOP in order to sell the products of its
business throughout Colombia digitally and facilitate the delivery and orders of
products.

For this, the project was carried out with the name of with the title of ISGREATSHOP
, made from the Angular framework. Using within this language of
HTML layout, the SASS style language, and the TYPESCRIPT programming language.

The date of delivery of the project made by the programmer Daniel Felipe Gomez Lopez
It was on December 22, 2022, therefore the methodology used was the following:

## Methodology

The project was built with pure code, it contains 3 global sections inside
this which are the following:

. Information: In this section are the pages and/or main components
from the website stories like home, about, store, contact us, terms and conditions.

. Policies: Within this section comes the legal part of the website, it contains the
pages with regulatory information such as privacy policy, policies
shipping, refund policy, track your equipment and cash on delivery.

. Categories: Within this section contains the specific products in the
general store, in which they are divided as products for the home,
technology, pets, beauty and fitness.

## Payment gateway

For the method of purchases and payment gateway, the shopping cart was used, whose
function is to add all the products that the user wants to buy for at the end
redirect it to the WhatsApp social network with which you can agree with the merchant
about the purchase and delivery of these. The option by product was also given
buy it individually directly through triidy (If you want more than one product
you will have to buy them by separate orders)

# Component layout

Thanks to the angular framework that gave us the possibility to keep our code
sections in a more orderly fashion. For this reason, a structure of
components with the purpose of having the 3 sections separated from each other.
The distribution of components and management of folders is carried out as follows
form:

# GENERAL SECTIONS AND COMPONENTS:

Component/Header
Component/Cart
Component/Sidebar
Component/Footer

# INFORMATION:

Component/Information/home
Component/Information/About us
Component/Information/Shop
Component/Information/contact us
Component/Information/Terms and conditions

# POLICIES:

Component/Politics/Privacy-policies
Component/Politics/Shipping-policies
Component/Politics/Refund-policy
Component/Politics/Track-your-order
Component/Politics/Payment-against-delivery

# CATEGORIES:

Component/Categories/Home
Component7Categories/Technology
Component/Categories/Pets
Component/Categories/Beauty
Component/Categories/Fitness

#PRODUCTS:

Component/Products/Home (separate products x8)
Component/Products/Technology (separate products x8)
Component/Products/Pets (separate products x8)
Component/Products/Beauty (separate products x8)

It is estimated that the project contains at least 59 Components
(Not including folders or number of products)

# Imports

The website in which the fonts were extracted was through "Google Fonts"
for which the insertion link of these was imported by the general HTML of the website.

Icons were also imported using "Fontawesome" which was inserted into the folder with the icons
loaded into Asssets, called Fontawesome.

Finally, a folder was implemented within assets called "img" which contains all
the necessary images for the website (Products, backgrounds, etc.)

# build order

For the order of creation from 0 to completion it was as follows:
. Realization of the complete back-log
. Realization of mobile and desktop designs by FIGMA
. complements implemented in assets (Logo, images, information, icons etc.)
. Creation of the Angular Framework
. Component creation
. HTML, SASS AND TS

Once the project was created by Angular, it was uploaded to a repository on GitHub.
in order to keep your data saved.

# Conclusions and notes

The developer is not obligated to increase the client's sales
since his job was to develop the website, but not advertising, SEO or management of the
website itself if a prior contract is not reached.

This project is made with the purpose of complying with the last competition of the
Frontend area within the Bootcamp.

The website will be uploaded via GitHub-Pages
